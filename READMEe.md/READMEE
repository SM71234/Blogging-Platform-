### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Create Post**: Add a new post via `create.html`, which stores data in `localStorage`.
2. **View Posts**: Posts appear dynamically on `index.html` with edit/delete options.
3. **Edit Post**: Clicking "Edit" redirects to `edit.html` with pre-filled data via URL params.
4. **Delete Post**: Clicking "Delete" removes the post and updates the list in real-time.
